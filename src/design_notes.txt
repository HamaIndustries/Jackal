design ideas to keep things straight

JACKAL's Anotha ChunkA Loada seeks to right the wrongs of the past and bring glory to this time.

JACKAL concentrates on intelligent chunk loading management strategies: Ideally,
the minimum number of chunks possible should be loaded at any one time.

The first means of accomplishing our task will be through use of primary and secondary
chunk loaders (PCLs and SCLs). These keep the chunk they are in loaded when the following rules
are obeyed:

Primary:
- This is the only CL in the chunk
- This CL is powered (redstone/energy/whatever)

Secondary: Same rules as above, AND
- This SCL is in range (according to some range metric) of a powered and loaded PCL

Accordingly, they have certain capabilities:

Primary:
- On some trigger, wake up this chunk and all available SCLs in range

---------------
Beyond abstraction, we now discuss implementation.

On place/load, PCLs must:
- load the current chunk
- load stored list of SCL positions
- update list based on 
- Next, if powered, PCLs load all known SCL chunks
