# JAKAL's (not) Anotha chunKA Loada

The goal of JAKAL is to bridge the gap in automation utilities that existed as of its creation. Many problems in modded Minecraft go unaddressed due to (understandable) challenges in satisfying player needs and overcoming technology limitations.

Presently, JAKAL includes conditional chunkloading capabilities: Loading specific chunks based on some triggered condition such as redstone, or a Create train's presence at a station.

Going forward, JAKAL will include some other utilities:
- Item transfer/storage
    + custom size inventories
    + custom size inventory slots
    + filtered inventory slots
    + batch input/output
- Odd-tick redstone components, as with the copper bulb introduced in 1.21.
